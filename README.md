# artemide-development
The public repository of artemide package for TMD-physics (transverse momentum dependent).
Here you can find the current unstable version of artemide.

Starting from the ver.3.02 _artemide_ includes files of _snowflake_ (VladimirovAlexey/SnowFlake). They are compiled together, and the snowflake rutines can be used within the models for TMD-distributions, although principal codes for each of these packages are mutually independent.

The stable version is in VladimirovAlexey/artemide-public repository.
The artemide version2 is in VladimirovAlexey/artemide2 repository.
The standalone version of snoflake is in VladimirovAlexey/SnowFlake repository.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	CHECK:
	In makefile set (in the begining of file)
	FCompiler    	<= your prefered fortran compiler (f95 at least, gfortran also works)
	Fflags		<= The flags to be used by compiler (e.g. if you use openmp). 
 			   Use default version if do not know what to set here. 
       			 **The flag -cpp MUST be present** (to compile pre-processor directives correctly)
	FOPT		<= For extra options, links,etc. see LHAPDF (not used in version better then v3.01)
	
	the harpy compiles with the help of f2py package from numpy (python2)
	
	The file "constants" must be in the same location as your program. Also check it, it accumulates all options.

Commands in make

make
=> Compiles the artemide package (complete)

make artemide
=> Compiles the artemide only

make snow
=> Compiles the snowflake only

make test
=> Compiles the simple test code and runs it

make test-snow
=> Compiles the simple test code for snowflake and runs it

make harpy
=> Compiles the harpy from artemide

make program TARGET=path
=> Compiles a program abc.f90 "path" with artemide

make update TARGET=path
=> Updates the constants file "path" to the current version of artemide

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The _snowflake_ is used together with pre-computed kernels. These files are too large to be included into repository (upto 300-400 Mb depending on the setup). They could be created by compiling abd running _Prog_snowflake/saveKernels.f90_ (see details in the file itself). This could take few hours for dense grids. Alternatively, I can send them by request.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Older (<3.01) versions of artemide use LHAPDF* it should be specified in make file. Modern versions do not need it.
