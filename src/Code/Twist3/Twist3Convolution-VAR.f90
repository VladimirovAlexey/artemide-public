!	This file contains the part of the code, which is common for all TMD-evaluation modules that operates at twist-3
!	ONLY DECLARATION OF VARIABLES that are used in twist2Convolution
!	It shares the variables with the module where it is inlucded (as a text)
!	Such idiotic structure is needed since, FORTRAN does not allow inheritance.
!
!	Be AWARE of possible clash of variable names.
!
!	SO FAR THERE IS NO TWIST-3 CONVOLUTION IMPLEMENTATION
