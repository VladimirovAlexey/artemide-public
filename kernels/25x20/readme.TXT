The tables 25x20 are too large to be stored in the ordinary git-hub repository. 
If you need them there are two options: 
1) Generate them manually with the program "saveKernels.f90". For it open this file, uncomment required section -- the one which use ini-file kernels25x20.ini [you could change specifications if you want], and run it with "make program TARGET=Program_snowflake/saveKernels.f90"). It could take significant time (up to 20 hours, depending on the computer)
2) Contact me: Alexey Vladimirov alexeyvl@ucm.es and I will send these files (~1.5 Gb) in some way.
